**Welcome to Only Choss!**

Only Choss is a counter culture climbing website. Where most climbing apps rate boulders by stars, more stars meaning a better boulder,
Only Choss is the opposite. The rating system here is band-aids, the more band-aids the more crumbly and unpleasant the boulder will be. 
It's less that I'm solving a problem and more that I'm creating one with this app, boulders that are comfortable and fun don't exist here. 
If experiences that're completely devoid of joy become fun to you simply because of how bleak it is then
stop by and pull up a chair. You may leave bleeding and borderline injured but don't worry- the rock probably fell apart too.
